# Saturday 17 Jan 2026 | Revising & Modifying All Epics & Features

## What I did
- Went through all the Epics I’ve already created (Epic 0 – Epic 8) and actually read them properly again.
- Looked at the features under each Epic and checked whether they still made sense now that I understand the domain a bit better.
- Merged some features that didn’t need to be separate and were just adding noise.
- Split a few features that were getting too big and starting to creep into other areas.
- Rewrote a lot of the Epic and Feature descriptions to be clearer about what they’re actually responsible for.
- Updated things based on what I now understand about oil rigs, OT environments, what a real security program looks like, and how IEC 62443 is meant to be applied in practice.

## Decisions
- Features need to stay small and focused. I feel like if they start doing too much, they should probably be split into multiple features i prefer smaller features cos that means smaller tasks as well when i do eventually get to the stage of creating the tasks for these features.
- I feel like some of my Features should maybe be moved to different Epics to avoid scope creep, but ill look into that next time cos im too tired right now.
- Security stuff needed to be made explicit, so ive decided i need to start writing my Epics and Features as if they'll be read by someone with no domain knowledge at all.
- I probably should have had a system design Epic from the start, so I’m going to fix that now instead of hacking around it later.

## Next
- Sit down and identify a few missing Epics that should exist in this project.
- At a minimum, add Epics for:
  - CVEs / vulnerability management
  - System design & architecture
  - DevOps / CI-CD / containers
  - Performance, load, and stress testing
- Think through how these new Epics actually fit into RigAtlas instead of just dumping them in.
- Start sketching out features for each of them once the Epics feel right.
