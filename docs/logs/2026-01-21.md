# Wed 21 Jan 2026 | Looking at P&ID Diagrams

## What I did
- Since my last log on Sunday the 18th of Jan till today, I have been looking at Level 0 of the purdue model quite closely
- Now, i do certainly have experience bulding a dynamic purdue level model, as this was my final year university project, however ive been wondering. Doesnt Level 0 have any devices
- As it turns out we just typically dont show the level 0 devices, and instead place empty rectangles in level 0 labeled as 'field devices', because level 0 doesnt concern cyber security
- Which made me wonder what son level 0 and if it doesnt get auited at all.
- Level 0 is where the real phical equipment is. There is no network in level 0 instead this is where the processing machinery , sensors, conveyor belts, distilling containers etc are found
- So as things stand, im looking into something engoineers call a Piping and Instrumental Diagram (P&ID). this is a document that shoiws where everything on a site is, in terms of level 0
- Once i have suffecient research on the subject, i'll be adding a an Epic with this in it. as i think there is a lot of value there
- The diagrams are very hard to understand as I obviously nevertook physics in uni so i dont know much about valve types and stuff, but ill figure it out. im just watching a lot of youtube videos right now.

## Decisions
- None have been made yet, just still researching and seeing how possible it is to draw this diagram dynamically. which at the moment looks exteremely difficult so ill need to think of it in small chunks

## Next
- Next is just more research, might look into the simpler Process Flow Diagram (PFD) and see if thats any easier to create dynamically off an asset inventory.
- Potentially, I might look into doing the Process Flow Diagram instead, then later down the line I can always build on that and provide the option of a P&ID, however if both have the same level of complexity to impliment, I think i'll just do the P&ID since its the official document used anyway.
- Oh and i think i might be dithcing the whole SQL thing for the purdue level model diagram. im really really considering a graph db like Neo4j, but befrore that i need to research that firstand see whats so different about it complared to using sql.
- Im also going to look into switching the actually library to D3.JS; so from the research ive done so far , it seems that D3 JS may be one of the hardest graph libraries to learna and use, but the advantage to it is it gives you so much control to create 'not so straight forward diagrams', so i might go for it for that reason. Besides, ive been doing so much React JS at work, i think ive lost touch of just coding in Vanilla JS, which i assume ill need a lot of experience in, to pull off this D3.JS integration into RigAtlas.
- So yeah... im very very far away from writing my first line of code. i need a lot of clarity of what this problem ve found is, and exactly all the ways i can solve it. since i dont have much domain knowledge, research is my best friend right now. It is getting boring though, cos i just wanna start coding, but there's a lot to do.
- I still need to do system design High Level Deisign(HLD) and Low Level Design(LLD) diagrams later before I start.
